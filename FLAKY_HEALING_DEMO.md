# Flaky / Healing Demo Tests

Deliberately bad leave-flow tests for trying out flaky-test detection and
self-healing tools. They sit apart from the real suite: every one is in the
TestNG group `demo`, which `regression.xml` excludes. None of the demo
suites attach `RetryListener`, so a failure is never hidden by a retry.

| Run | Command | Class |
|---|---|---|
| Flaky set | `mvn clean test -Pflaky` | `tests/leave/LeaveFlakyTest.java` |
| Healable set | `mvn clean test -Phealable` | `tests/leave/LeaveHealableTest.java` |
| Broken set (unhealable + normal failures) | `mvn clean test -Pbroken` | `tests/leave/LeaveBrokenTest.java` |
| Everything | `mvn clean test -Pdemo` | all three |

The test name says what kind of test it is. The `@Test` description (shown in
the Extent report) starts with the same tag and says why the test fails.

| Prefix / suffix | Tag in report | What to expect | What a healer should do |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FLAKY_TC_…_FLAKY` | `[FLAKY]` | Passes on some runs and fails on others, often at a different step each time | Nothing permanent. The cause is timing, data and test design, not a stale locator |
| `HEALABLE_TC_…_HEALABLE` | `[HEALABLE]` | Fails every run with `NoSuchElementException` on one `BROKEN_*` locator | **Heal it.** The intended element is on the page. After healing, the test should pass |
| `UNHEALABLE_TC_…_UNHEALABLE` | `[UNHEALABLE]` | Fails every run. The feature, page or message doesn't exist, or the script itself crashes | **Report "could not heal".** Picking some other element and calling it healed is a wrong heal |
| `NORMALFAIL_TC_…_ASSERTION` | `[NORMAL-FAIL]` | Fails every run on an assertion. Every locator and step works | **Don't touch it.** It's an ordinary test failure: the expectation is wrong |

---

## FLAKY set: `LeaveFlakyTest`

Raw `driver.findElement`, index-based XPaths, `Thread.sleep`, hardcoded
credentials and unclear helper names (`doLogin(int)`, `num(int)`,
`fillStuff`, `doIt`, `clk`, `jclk`, `chk`, `wt`, `getD`). Every locator
matches the app today, so each test can pass. Two fields (Admin's Target
Employee and the Reason box) borrow framework helpers, because plain
`sendKeys` into them never sticks and the tests could never pass otherwise.

| Test | Flow | Why it's flaky |
|---|---|---|
| `FLAKY_TC_LEAVE_01_adminRecordsLeave_FLAKY` | Admin records leave for sales1 → Approved +1, first Approved row matches | The random date can fall on a weekly off (Sunday or 2nd/4th Saturday), which disables Record Leave. Counts are read after a fixed sleep. Assumes the new row is row 0. Grid shows `Sept`, the test expects `Sep` |
| `FLAKY_TC_LEAVE_02_adminLeaveVisibleToHr_FLAKY` | Admin records → HR sees it in the first 3 Approved rows | Same as 01, plus a sign-out and sign-in done with fixed sleeps |
| `FLAKY_TC_LEAVE_03_hrAppliesAdminApproves_FLAKY` | HR submits for approval → Admin approves the **first** Pending row | Assumes HR's request is the first Pending row. Weekly-off dates. The Pending count is read after a fixed sleep. Two sign-ins |
| `FLAKY_TC_LEAVE_04_hrAppliesAdminRejects_FLAKY` | HR submits → Admin rejects → HR checks the Rejected tab | Three sign-ins, each typed after a fixed sleep. Sometimes the page re-renders and wipes the fields. Reads the status cell by position (`div[6]`) |
| `FLAKY_TC_LEAVE_05_invalidLeaveNotSaved_FLAKY` | Empty submit, then an end date before the start date, are both refused; counts unchanged | Both dates are random, so the "invalid" range is sometimes valid. Relies on Escape plus a fixed sleep to close the drawer |

Other causes: no handling for the daily check-in reminder (it appears on each
persona's first login of the day), random dates that can overlap an earlier
run, and grid loading time that varies.

**Observed on 2026-10-06** (last 3 runs, no retries): 01 passed 1 of 3,
05 passed 3 of 3, and 02, 03 and 04 failed every time, each run at a different
step. 02–04 have the longest flows, so they pass least often. If they need to
pass more often, lengthen the `wt(...)` sleeps.

## HEALABLE set: `LeaveHealableTest`

Each test is a real end-to-end flow, written properly. It fails only because of
one `BROKEN_*` locator, marked `<-- BROKEN LOCATOR` in the step log. All five
were run green with the correct locators before the broken ones were put back.

| Test | Flow | Broken locator | Correct locator |
|---|---|---|---|
| `HEALABLE_TC_LEAVE_01_adminRecordsLeave_brokenButtonText_HEALABLE` | Admin records leave → Approved | `//button[normalize-space(.)='Apply Leave']` (text changed) | `//button[normalize-space(.)='Apply for Leave']` |
| `HEALABLE_TC_LEAVE_02_hrSubmitsForApproval_brokenAttribute_HEALABLE` | HR submits own leave → Pending +1 | `//textarea[@name='leaveReason']` (attribute never existed) | `//textarea[contains(@placeholder,'reason for leave')]` |
| `HEALABLE_TC_LEAVE_03_approvedCountRises_brokenClassName_HEALABLE` | Admin records → Approved chip +1 | `//span[contains(@class,'MuiChip-lable')][starts-with(normalize-space(.),'Approved (')]` (class typo) | `…[contains(@class,'MuiChip-label')]…` |
| `HEALABLE_TC_LEAVE_04_adminApprovesHrLeave_brokenTestId_HEALABLE` | HR submits → Admin approves that row | `{row}//button[@data-testid='approve-leave']` (test-id not rendered) | `{row}//button[normalize-space(.)='Approve']` |
| `HEALABLE_TC_LEAVE_05_adminRejectsHrLeave_brokenDataField_HEALABLE` | HR submits → Admin rejects → status cell says Rejected | `{row}//div[@data-field='leave_status']` (column renamed) | `{row}//div[@data-field='status']` |

`{row}` is the grid row matching the request's status and date.

Healers that learn from a passing run (Healenium-style) need a green baseline
first. Run once with the correct locators, then restore the broken ones.

## BROKEN set: `LeaveBrokenTest`

Worst-quality code on purpose: static mutable fields, copy-pasted login,
`catch (Throwable)` and rethrow, `System.out.println`, magic sleeps, and no
report steps. Every test fails on every run.

| Test | Category | Why it fails |
|---|---|---|
| `UNHEALABLE_TC_LEAVE_01_bulkApproveAllPending_featureMissing_UNHEALABLE` | Unhealable | Clicks a "Bulk Approve All" button. The app has no such feature |
| `UNHEALABLE_TC_LEAVE_02_leaveApprovalsV2Page_routeMissing_UNHEALABLE` | Unhealable | Opens `/leaves/approvals-v2`, which doesn't exist, then waits for its heading and table |
| `UNHEALABLE_TC_LEAVE_03_tabTotals_scriptBug_UNHEALABLE` | Unhealable | The test code crashes with a `NullPointerException` on a map that is never created (and a bad number parse after that). Every locator is fine |
| `UNHEALABLE_TC_LEAVE_04_successToastAfterSubmit_messageNeverShown_UNHEALABLE` | Unhealable | Submits an empty form and waits for a "Leave applied successfully" toast. The app never shows one |
| `NORMALFAIL_TC_LEAVE_05_adminRecordedLeaveExpectedPending_wrongExpectation_ASSERTION` | Normal failure | Expects admin-recorded leave to go to Pending. The app auto-approves it |
| `NORMALFAIL_TC_LEAVE_06_casualEntitlementIs20_staleTestData_ASSERTION` | Normal failure | Expects a 20-day Casual entitlement. The tenant policy is 15 |

## Leave balance will run out

Every Admin flow records **Casual** leave for **sales1**. After this session's
runs, sales1 has **4** Casual days left. When it reaches 0, FLAKY 01/02,
HEALABLE 01/03 and NORMALFAIL 05 will fail because of the balance, not
because of what they're meant to show. A healed HEALABLE test would still be
red. Top up or reset sales1's Casual balance in the tenant, or point
`TARGET_EMPLOYEE` / `emp` at another employee. HR's own Casual balance drains
the same way through the HR flows (13 left).

## Side effects on the test tenant

Each run adds leave records. FLAKY 01/02, HEALABLE 01/03 and NORMALFAIL 05 add
Approved leave for sales1. The HR flows add HR leave that ends up Approved,
Rejected or, if a test fails partway, left Pending. FLAKY 05 sometimes records a
leave when its random "invalid" date range turns out to be valid. Leave dates
are random, so records rarely collide, but sales1's and HR's balances go down
over many runs.
